# Some notes regarding the project
<hr>
<p>
  In the project, we were supposed to submit only a pdf file (write up) and code (.ipynb jupyter notebooks)<br>
  However, This information is not enough, and we wanted to save more information in one centralized place.<br>
</p>



<p>
  In here, you will find:<br>
  <b>main folder</b> - In here you will find the pdf for writeup assignment, as well as editable doc file, .ipynb file (concentrate all models into 1 file) and 1 .html file (replicate .ipynb in html       
  format).<br>
  <b>Variables</b> - in this folder you will find all the relevant information regarding the variables after manipulation and standardization for each model.<br>
  <b>Data</b> - This is the data source(s) for the project.<br>
  <b>Evaluations</b> - This folder contains the evaluation of the models, and any visualization related to it. 
  <b>Notes</b> - Every model will have our notes. These notes are not part of the writeup, and they will be <u>short</u>. These notes will include the conclusions for the models as well.
</p>

<p>
  Please note that we used various AI models to achieve the best result in writing code, standardizing variables and evaluating results, and based on university code we hereby put a disclaimer. <br>
  However, most of the work is authentic and we bring what we learned in class to practice in this final project.
