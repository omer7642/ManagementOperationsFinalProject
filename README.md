# Final Project - Management of Operations and Production

This is our Final year's project in Management of Operations and Production. This repository was created especially for this project.
## Written by : Omer Zinman & Eran Schlezinger

  In the project, we were supposed to submit only a pdf file (write up) and code (.ipynb jupyter notebooks)<br>
  However, This information is not enough, and we wanted to save more information in one centralized place.<br>


## The project is divided as follows
  <u><b>Main folder</b></u> - In here you will find the pdf for writeup assignment, as well as an editable doc file, .ipynb file (which encorporates all models into 1 file) and 1 .html file (replicate 
  .ipynb in html format).<br>
  <u><b>Variables</b></u> - In this folder you will find all the relevant information regarding the variables after manipulation and standardization for each model.<br>
  <u><b>Data</b></u> - This is the data source(s) for the project.<br>
  <u><b>Evaluations</b></u> - This folder contains the evaluation of the models, and any visualization related to it. <br>
  <u><b>Notes</b></u> - Every model will have our notes. These notes are not part of the writeup, and they will be <i>short</i>. These notes will include the conclusions for the models as well. 
  (Conclusions for each model will be in the .ipynb and .html files as well)<br>



## Credit
  Please note that we used various AI models to achieve the best result in writing code, standardizing variables and evaluating results, and based on university code we hereby put a disclaimer. <br>
  However, most of the work is authentic and we bring what we learned in class to practice in this final project.
